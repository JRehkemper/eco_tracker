## About EcoTracker
### What is EcoTracker
EcoTracker is a way to motivate you, to reduce your carbon footprint. Every kilometer you ride your bike or skates or simplay walk, you earn points. This way you can compete against other users and earn achievements. You will also help to reach community goals and motivate others. You can create and join teams to combine your scores and climb the leaderboard. This way, we can all work together and help to stop the climate change.

### How it Works
Everytime you want to collect points you have to start a new tour. This way you can control when EcoTrack may get your location and when not. While you are recording a tour, the app will get your location and will calculate the distance between the different locations. After that the total distance is submitted to the server and added to your overall score. This the information about your loacation will never leave your device. We will never save any positiondata on our server.
